# challenge-01-horiseon

## Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

Horiseon is a fictional company that specializes in helping other companies with search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. The goal of this challenge was to bring the site's html up to current semantic and accessibility standards.

## Changes made

The html was initially a "div soup" but many divs were replaced with semantic elements and some divs were deleted due to unnecessary nesting. This lead to the corresponding CSS rules needing to be updated respectively. Headings were organized in sequential order. Also, alt attributes were added to all images.
